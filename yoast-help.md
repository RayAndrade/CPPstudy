Short answer: **yes, Yoast SEO *is* helpful — but only to a point**.
It’s a **support tool**, not a growth engine. I’ll be precise and realistic.

## What Yoast SEO *Actually* Does Well

**Yoast SEO** mainly helps with **baseline SEO hygiene**.

### 1️⃣ On-page basics (this is its real value)

Yoast helps you:

* Set a proper **page title**
* Write a **meta description**
* Ensure you use headings (`H1`, `H2`, etc.) correctly
* Avoid obvious SEO mistakes

👉 This prevents *self-inflicted SEO damage*.

**Estimated benefit:**
🟢 **10–20% improvement** over *no SEO tool at all*

---

### 2️⃣ Readability checks (light help)

It flags:

* Very long sentences
* Dense paragraphs
* Missing transitions

For technical blogs (coding), this is:

* mildly useful
* sometimes misleading (code explanations naturally break rules)

👉 Treat these suggestions as **optional**, not law.

**Estimated benefit:**
🟡 **Small (5–10%)**, mostly for beginners

---

### 3️⃣ XML sitemaps & indexing

Yoast:

* Generates sitemaps
* Helps search engines crawl your site

This is **important once**, then mostly invisible.

**Estimated benefit:**
🟢 Necessary, but **not ongoing growth**

---

## What Yoast SEO Does *NOT* Do (Important)

Yoast **does not**:

* Bring traffic by itself
* Make content rank if nobody searches for it
* Compete with strong sites just by “green lights”
* Understand teaching authority or GitHub-linked content

Many people misunderstand this and overestimate it.

---

## For *Your* Specific Case (Coding + YouTube + GitHub)

Given what you’re doing, Yoast’s role is **supportive, not central**.

### Yoast helps you:

* Make sure each blog post isn’t broken SEO-wise
* Cleanly present posts that embed YouTube videos
* Keep metadata consistent across posts

### What actually drives growth for you:

1. **YouTube videos** (primary discovery)
2. **Evergreen teaching content**
3. **GitHub repositories**
4. **Internal linking between blog ↔ video ↔ GitHub**

Yoast sits *underneath* this — it doesn’t replace it.

## A Practical Way to Use Yoast (No Stress)

Use Yoast **only for these 3 checks**:

1. Page has a clear title
2. Meta description is written (not auto-generated)
3. One main keyword is *naturally* present

Ignore:

* Obsessing over green lights
* Keyword stuffing warnings
* Over-optimizing readability for code posts

---

## Honest Bottom Line

* ❌ Yoast will **not** double your traffic
* ✅ Yoast will **keep you from shooting yourself in the foot**
* 📊 Realistic overall impact: **~15% assist**, not a breakthrough

For your launch and long-term plan:

> **Yoast is useful — but YouTube + teaching clarity + consistency matter far more.**

If you want, next time we can:

* Define *exactly* how to write a Yoast-friendly post **for a coding video**
* Create a simple blog-post template you reuse every time (no guesswork)

Just say the word.
