I lost sound to watching my youtube videos… the last applications that i have installed are jackd and ALSA Sequencer kernal modual  snd-seq-midi . how can I get the sound to the youtube videos I am watching??

I have tried to open a *.mp3 file open with videos and did not hear any sound

Thanks — that confirms the issue is system-wide and not just YouTube.

Let’s continue step by step.

### **Step 2: Check audio output and devices**
Let’s use `pavucontrol` (PulseAudio Volume Control) to inspect what’s happening.

#### ✅ Do this:
1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   pavucontrol
   ```

   If it’s not installed, install it with:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install pavucontrol
   ```

2. Once `pavucontrol` opens:
   - Go to the **"Playback"** tab. While playing the MP3, check if anything shows up there.
   - Go to the **"Output Devices"** tab:
     - Ensure **one device is not muted** and has volume.
     - Try switching the **“Port”** (e.g., between “Speakers” and “Headphones”).
   - Go to the **"Configuration"** tab:
     - Check if a sound card profile is selected (e.g., “Analog Stereo Output” or “Digital Stereo Output”).

Let me know what you find:
- Do you see any signal in the “Playback” tab when audio is playing?
- Are there any available output devices shown?

Once I know this, I’ll guide you to the next step.

under the Output Devices I read PO100X podcast port speakes and builtinaudio Analog Headphines plugged in ,,

Thanks! That gives us something to work with.

It sounds like you have two output devices listed:

1. **PO100X Podcast Port Speakers**  
2. **Built-in Audio Analog Headphones (plugged in)**

Let’s troubleshoot the output routing.

### **Step 3: Test Switching Output Devices**

#### ✅ In the **“Output Devices”** tab of `pavucontrol`:
1. **Unmute** both devices (if either is muted — look for the little speaker icon).
2. Try clicking the **"green checkmark"** on one device to make it the **default output**.
   - Start with **Built-in Audio Analog Headphones**.
3. While playing the MP3, go to the **"Playback"** tab:
   - You should see a stream labeled something like “Videos” or your media player.
   - To the right, you’ll see a dropdown — **make sure it’s set to the correct output device** (same one you selected in “Output Devices”).

#### ✅ Now:
- Try **switching** the default output device (PO100X vs. Built-in) and test playback each time.
- If headphones are plugged in, try **unplugging them**, and test again — sometimes the system routes sound only through the headphones when they’re detected.

---

Let me know:
- Which device shows sound activity (moving volume bars)?
- Whether switching default devices gets sound working?
- Or if still nothing shows in “Playback” when audio is playing?

We’ll keep going from there.
