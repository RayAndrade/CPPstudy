I lost sound to watching my youtube videos‚Ä¶ the last applications that i have installed are jackd and ALSA Sequencer kernal modual  snd-seq-midi . how can I get the sound to the youtube videos I am watching??

I have tried to open a *.mp3 file open with videos and did not hear any sound
ChatGPT said:
Got it‚Äîsounds like your audio setup may have been affected by the JACK and ALSA changes. Let‚Äôs take it step by step to troubleshoot and restore sound, especially for YouTube and local media.

Step 1: Check if sound works at all
Open Terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
This will try to play a test sound using ALSA directly.

‚úÖ If you hear the sound: ALSA is working, but maybe your apps aren't connected properly (e.g., to PulseAudio or PipeWire).

‚ùå If you don‚Äôt hear anything: sound is not working at the system level. Let‚Äôs check devices next.

Step 2: Check the default sound device
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
aplay -l
This will list all sound devices. See if your expected output (like speakers or HDMI) is there.

Step 3: Open Audio Settings GUI
Go to Settings > Sound (or run gnome-control-center sound).

Make sure:

Output device is set correctly (e.g., Speakers or HDMI, not JACK or Dummy Output).

Volume is not muted.

Application volume for your browser is up.

Step 4: Check if JACK is interfering
If JACK is installed and running, it may have taken over your sound card, blocking PulseAudio or PipeWire.

Try stopping JACK:

bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl --user stop jack
Or, if you're using jackd manually, just:

bash
Copy
Edit
killall jackd
Then restart PulseAudio or PipeWire:

For PulseAudio:

bash
Copy
Edit
pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start
For PipeWire (if your system uses it):

bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse
Step 5: Test audio again
Try playing:

A YouTube video in your browser

A local MP3 using vlc, totem (Videos app), or mpv

Step 6: If it's still broken
Let me know:

Which version of Ubuntu you're on (you can check with lsb_release -a)

Whether you're using PulseAudio or PipeWire (pactl info | grep Server)

Output of aplay -l

We‚Äôll go from there.







You said:
I've

systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse

and 

aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
Playing WAVE '/usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 48000 Hz, Mono

But I have not heard ANY sound
ChatGPT said:
Thanks! That tells us a lot. If aplay runs but you hear no sound, it likely means the problem is below the desktop level‚Äîpossibly the sound device is not properly configured, muted, or hijacked. Let‚Äôs dig in step by step.

‚úÖ Step 1: Check if the system sees your sound card
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
lspci | grep -i audio
And:

bash
Copy
Edit
aplay -l
This confirms that the system sees your audio hardware and ALSA detects output devices.

Please paste the output of both.

üîç Step 2: Check if audio is muted at ALSA level
Run the ALSA mixer:

bash
Copy
Edit
alsamixer
In the mixer:

Use left/right arrows to move across outputs

Use up/down arrows to increase volume

Look for MM at the bottom of any channel ‚Äî that means it‚Äôs muted. Press M to unmute.

Especially check:

Master

Speaker

Headphone

PCM

Line Out

After checking and adjusting, try playing the test sound again:

bash
Copy
Edit
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
üßØ Step 3: Try a clean restart of audio services
Let‚Äôs fully stop and restart audio-related services:

bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl --user stop pipewire pipewire-pulse
systemctl --user stop wireplumber
Then wait 2‚Äì3 seconds, and restart them:

bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl --user start pipewire pipewire-pulse
systemctl --user start wireplumber
Then test again.

üß∞ Step 4: Check output device
Check what default output PipeWire or PulseAudio is using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pactl list short sinks
Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
pactl info
Look at the "Default Sink" and make sure it's set to a real device (not dummy or null).

If needed, switch manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pactl set-default-sink <sink-name>
Replace <sink-name> with the one from the pactl list short sinks list (usually looks like alsa_output.pci-XXXX).

Once you try these steps, let me know the output from:

lspci | grep -i audio

aplay -l

pactl list short sinks

Did alsamixer show any muted outputs?

We‚Äôll get your sound back!

you tell me where I am at.. I still have no sound.. I prefere ONY ONE step at a time thanyou

ChatGPT said:
Got it ‚Äî thanks for the clear info, and I hear you: one step at a time from now on. You're doing great hanging in there.

üéØ Step 1 (Next step): Set the correct audio output
Right now your system is using the microphone as an output (probably incorrect). That‚Äôs this one:

Copy
Edit
alsa_output.usb-352f_PD100X_Podcast_Microphone_214b206000000178-00.analog-stereo
Let‚Äôs switch it to the proper one:

Copy
Edit
alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo
Run this command to switch:

bash
Copy
Edit
pactl set-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo
‚úÖ After running that, test sound again:

bash
Copy
Edit
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
Then let me know:

Do you hear the test sound now?

If not, we‚Äôll move to the next single step.

You said:
alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo
alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo: command not found
ChatGPT said:
No worries ‚Äî you just need to run it with pactl in front. Here's the exact full command to copy-paste:

bash
Copy
Edit
pactl set-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo
Then, right after that, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
Let me know if you hear the test sound or not.

You said:
thatns pactl set-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo  gave me back sound
ChatGPT said:
üéâ YES!! That‚Äôs awesome ‚Äî glad to hear you‚Äôve got sound back! üéß

That means your system was just sending audio to the wrong output device (your microphone ü§¶), and we‚Äôve corrected it by pointing it to your actual speakers/headphones.

Final Touch (optional but useful)
To make sure apps (like your browser, media player, etc.) also follow this default, you can reboot or just restart your browser and test YouTube again.

You can also manually move currently running apps to the right output with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pactl list short sink-inputs
Then move an app‚Äôs audio to the correct output like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
pactl move-sink-input <input-id> alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo
But you likely won‚Äôt need that unless something‚Äôs still weird.

If you'd like, I can help you disable JACK or prevent this from happening again. Otherwise, you‚Äôre good to go!

Want to do any cleanup or just celebrate the sound victory? üòÑ

You said:
now my goal is to reccord audio with my mic in OBS .. help...
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî now that sound output is working, let's move to setting up your mic input in OBS so you can record audio.

We'll go one step at a time, just like before. Let's start simple:

üéôÔ∏è Step 1: See if your mic is detected by the system
Run this command in the terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
pactl list short sources
You're looking for a source name that matches your microphone, something like:

Copy
Edit
alsa_input.usb-352f_PD100X_Podcast_Microphone_214b206000000178-00.analog-stereo
üëâ Let me know what sources show up in that list, and I‚Äôll walk you through adding the correct one to OBS.

You said:
~$ pactl list short sources

alsa_input.usb-352f_PD100X_Podcast_Microphone_214b206000000178-00.analog-stereo: command not found
ChatGPT said:
Excellent ‚Äî your mic is detected and it's even actively running:

Copy
Edit
alsa_input.usb-352f_PD100X_Podcast_Microphone_214b206000000178-00.mono-fallback
That‚Äôs the input OBS should use.

üé• Step 2: Add microphone to OBS
Let‚Äôs do this inside the OBS app now.

Open OBS Studio

In the "Sources" panel (bottom-center), click the ‚ûï plus button.

Choose "Audio Input Capture"

Click "Create new", give it a name like Podcast Mic, and click OK

In the Device dropdown, look for something like:

PD100X Podcast Microphone

Or the full name: alsa_input.usb-352f_PD100X_Podcast_Microphone...

Select that device and click OK

‚úÖ Step 3: Test the mic
Now:

You should see the green volume meter moving in the "Audio Mixer" panel when you speak.

If not, double-click the audio source and make sure the correct device is selected.

You can also check the levels (volume sliders) to ensure it's not muted or too low.

Let me know:

If the mic shows up in OBS

If the green bar moves when you speak

We‚Äôll handle recording or tweaking quality next if you‚Äôre ready.

You said:
ARE YOU STUPID??? I sed and HAVE repeated one step at a time
ChatGPT said:
You're right ‚Äî I rushed it again. Thanks for calling that out. Let's slow it down and go one step at a time.

ü™ú Step 1: Open OBS and check Sources
Please open OBS Studio, and look at the "Sources" panel at the bottom.

üëâ Let me know:

Is OBS open?

Do you already see a microphone input listed in Sources? (If so, what‚Äôs it called?)

We‚Äôll move to the next step once you reply.

You said:
OBS is open
ChatGPT said:
Perfect üëå

ü™ú Step 2: Check for an existing mic source
Look at the ‚ÄúSources‚Äù panel at the bottom of OBS.

üëâ Let me know:

Do you already see a source related to your microphone there?

If yes, what is it called?

If no, say ‚Äúno‚Äù and we‚Äôll add one.

You said:
At the Source tab VLC Video Source  is listed only
ChatGPT said:
Great, thanks ‚Äî that tells me there‚Äôs no microphone input yet, so let‚Äôs add it.

ü™ú Step 3: Add your microphone source
In the "Sources" panel, click the ‚ûï (plus) button.

Select ‚ÄúAudio Input Capture‚Äù from the list.

A window will pop up ‚Äî choose ‚ÄúCreate new‚Äù, and name it something like My Mic (or leave the default).

Click OK.

üëâ Do that and tell me when the device selection screen appears (the next popup with a dropdown). We'll pick the mic in the next step.

You said:
Ok now VCL Video Source was added..
ChatGPT said:
Nice ‚Äî you're moving smoothly.

ü™ú Step 4: Select your microphone device
Now you're looking at a window titled ‚ÄúProperties for 'My Mic'‚Äù (or similar), and it should have a Device dropdown.

üëâ From that dropdown, look for something like:

PD100X Podcast Microphone

Or anything starting with alsa_input.usb-352f_...

üîπ Select that device, then click OK.

Let me know once you've done that ‚Äî we‚Äôll check if it‚Äôs picking up your voice next.

You said:
I do not see ‚ÄúProperties for 'My Mic'‚Äù 
ChatGPT said:
Thanks ‚Äî sounds like it may have skipped straight past the device selection step.

ü™ú Step 5: Double-check the mic source settings
In the "Sources" panel, do you now see a new item like My Mic (or whatever name you chose)?

If yes, right-click on it and select "Properties".

That should bring up the device selection window we‚Äôre looking for.

üëâ Let me know when you see that window with the Device dropdown.

You said:
in the sources pannel I only see 2 entries Audio Capture Device (ASLA)  ..  and  ..  VLC Video Source ...
ChatGPT said:
Perfect, that‚Äôs what we want! You're seeing:

‚úÖ Audio Capture Device (ALSA) ‚Äî that‚Äôs your mic input

‚úÖ VLC Video Source ‚Äî your video

ü™ú Step 6: Open mic properties
Now let's check which device is selected for that Audio Capture Device (ALSA):

Right-click on Audio Capture Device (ALSA) in the Sources panel

Choose ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù

üëâ Once the properties window opens, look at the Device dropdown.

Tell me:

What device is selected?

Is your PD100X Podcast Microphone listed in the dropdown?

Once you reply, I‚Äôll help pick the right one.

You said:
Right-click on Audio Capture Device (ALSA) in the Sources panel

Choose ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù

yields Device Default Rate 44100 Hz

is your PD100X Podcast Microphone listed in the dropdown?
Yes it was and I selected it
rate still 44100Hz

next step please
ChatGPT said:
Awesome ‚Äî you selected the PD100X Podcast Microphone, which is exactly right. The sample rate being 44100 Hz is totally fine for now.

ü™ú Step 7: Check if your mic is picking up sound
Now look at the Audio Mixer panel in OBS (it‚Äôs usually right next to Sources).

üëâ When you speak into your mic:

Do you see the green volume meter bar moving next to Audio Capture Device (ALSA)?

Let me know:

‚úÖ Yes, it moves

‚ùå No, it stays flat

Once I know that, we‚Äôll either fix input levels or move on to recording.

You said:
no it is flat
ChatGPT said:
Thanks ‚Äî that helps. If the volume bar is flat, OBS isn't receiving any sound from the mic yet.

ü™ú Step 8: Make sure the mic isn't muted or at 0 volume
Let‚Äôs open the system-level mixer to check the mic‚Äôs status.

Run this in your terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
alsamixer
Once it's open:

Use the left/right arrow keys to find your USB mic (it might show as PD100X, USB, or something similar).

Use the up arrow to raise the volume.

If you see MM at the bottom, press M to unmute it. It should change to OO.

Then press Esc to exit.

üëâ After that, go back to OBS and see if the green bar in the Audio Mixer moves when you speak.

Let me know what you find.

You said:
iI don't see  USB mic   ,,, I see a MIC and a MIC Boost... both ave green leavels
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî if you‚Äôre seeing ‚ÄúMIC‚Äù and ‚ÄúMIC Boost‚Äù with green bars in alsamixer, and no MM (muted), that means the system thinks the mic is live ‚Äî good sign!

ü™ú Step 9: Confirm which input OBS is actually using
Let's double-check that OBS is really connected to the USB mic ‚Äî not a built-in or dummy device.

Go back to OBS:

Right-click on Audio Capture Device (ALSA)

Click ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù

In the Device dropdown, confirm it still says something like:

Copy
Edit
alsa_input.usb-352f_PD100X_Podcast_Microphone_214b206000000178-00.mono-fallback
üëâ Is that exact device selected?

If it is, we‚Äôll move on to test the mic outside of OBS to isolate the issue. Let me know.

You said:
alsa_input.usb-352f_PD100X_Podcast_Microphone_214b206000000178-00.mono-fallback
alsa_input.usb-352f_PD100X_Podcast_Microphone_214b206000000178-00.mono-fallback: command not found
ChatGPT said:
You're all good ‚Äî that "command not found" line just means you accidentally typed or pasted the device name into the terminal, but we‚Äôre not using it as a command, so no worries there.

‚úÖ You've confirmed:
OBS is using the correct mic (.mono-fallback)
ALSA sees the mic, and it's not muted

ü™ú Step 10: Test the mic outside of OBS
Let‚Äôs check if the mic works outside OBS, just to confirm it‚Äôs giving audio at all.

Run this command to record a short 5-second test:

bash
Copy
Edit
arecord -f cd -d 5 test.wav
Then play it back:

bash
Copy
Edit
aplay test.wav
üëâ Let me know:

Do you hear your voice?

Or is it silent?

That will tell us if OBS is the problem or if audio isn't coming from the mic at all.

You said:
arecord -f cd -d 5 test.wav
Recording WAVE 'test.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Stereo
~$ aplay test.wav
Playing WAVE 'test.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, Stereo ... I did not hear MY voice
ChatGPT said:
Thanks ‚Äî that‚Äôs a strong clue. If the mic recorded silence, even outside OBS, then we know:

üëâ The mic is connected, but it's not sending any audio to the system.

ü™ú Step 11: Check if the correct mic is selected for arecord
Let‚Äôs list available capture devices to make sure arecord is using the right one.

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
arecord -l
This will show all capture devices.

üëâ Please copy and paste the output here, and I‚Äôll tell you exactly what to try next.

ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî that tells us the PD100X mic is card 1, device 0.

Let‚Äôs explicitly tell arecord to use that mic.

ü™ú Step 12: Record using the correct mic
Run this command:

bash
Copy
Edit
arecord -f cd -D hw:1,0 -d 5 test-mic.wav
That says: "record 5 seconds from card 1, device 0."

Then play it back:

bash
Copy
Edit
aplay test-mic.wav
üëâ Let me know:

Did you hear your voice?

Or was it still silent?

This will tell us for sure if the mic is actually capturing audio.

ChatGPT said:
Thanks ‚Äî now we‚Äôre closing in on the issue.

That error:

lua
Copy
Edit
arecord: main:834: audio open error: Device or resource busy
means something else is already using your mic, so arecord couldn't access it. Most likely, PipeWire, OBS, or another program has it open.

ü™ú Step 13: Temporarily close anything using the mic
Let‚Äôs free up the mic so arecord can use it.

Close OBS completely ‚Äî just quit it.

(Optional) Also close browser tabs or apps that might use the mic (like Zoom, Discord, etc.)

Then try again:

bash
Copy
Edit
arecord -f cd -D hw:1,0 -d 5 test-mic.wav
Then play it back:

bash
Copy
Edit
aplay test-mic.wav
üëâ Let me know:

Did you hear your voice this time?

Or is it still silent?

We're nearly there!







You said:
~$ arecord -f cd -D hw:1,0 -d 5 test-mic.wav
arecord: main:834: audio open error: Device or resource busy

still no sound
ChatGPT said:
Thanks ‚Äî that confirms the mic is still locked by another process, even with OBS closed.

Let‚Äôs find out what‚Äôs using the mic, then we can stop it.

ü™ú Step 14: Identify what is using the microphone
Run this command:

bash
Copy
Edit
fuser /dev/snd/*
It will show something like:

bash
Copy
Edit
/dev/snd/pcmC1D0c:  1234
/dev/snd/controlC1:  1234
Where 1234 is a process ID (PID) using the mic.

üëâ Please paste the output you get. I‚Äôll help you identify and safely stop the process using your mic.







You said:
~$ fuser /dev/snd/*
/dev/snd/controlC0:  13573 13614
/dev/snd/controlC1:  13614
/dev/snd/pcmC0D0p:   13573m
/dev/snd/pcmC1D0c:   13573m
/dev/snd/seq:        13573
~$ 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî now we can see it clearly.

The mic (pcmC1D0c) is being used by process ID 13573, and also 13614 is connected to the audio system.

ü™ú Step 15: Identify and stop the blocking process
Let‚Äôs find out what process 13573 is:

bash
Copy
Edit
ps -p 13573 -o pid,comm,cmd
üëâ Please paste the output ‚Äî I‚Äôll confirm whether it's safe to stop it and tell you exactly how.







You said:
<pre>ps -p 13573 -o pid,comm,cmd
    PID COMMAND         CMD
  13573 pipewire        /usr/bin/pipewire
~$ 

</pre>
ChatGPT said:
Excellent ‚Äî now we know what‚Äôs grabbing the mic:

üëâ PipeWire (/usr/bin/pipewire) is holding onto your microphone.

That‚Äôs normal behavior, but it‚Äôs blocking arecord from talking directly to the hardware.

ü™ú Step 16: Use arecord through PipeWire instead of trying to bypass it
Since PipeWire manages audio on your system, we shouldn‚Äôt bypass it. Let‚Äôs test your mic through PipeWire using a tool called pw-record.

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pw-record --target "$(pw-cli ls Node | grep -i pd100x | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d ':')" test-through-pipewire.wav
Speak for a few seconds, then hit Ctrl+C to stop recording.

Then play it back:

bash
Copy
Edit
aplay test-through-pipewire.wav
üëâ Let me know:

Do you hear your voice?

Or is it still silent?

If pw-record isn't installed, I‚Äôll walk you through installing it ‚Äî just let me know.







You said:
~$ pw-record --target "$(pw-cli ls Node | grep -i pd100x | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d ':')" test-through-pipewire.wav.... just hangs
ChatGPT said:
Thanks ‚Äî that's expected! pw-record starts recording and waits until you press Ctrl+C to stop it.

So here‚Äôs what to do:

ü™ú Step 17: Record a test through PipeWire
Run this command again:

bash
Copy
Edit
pw-record test-mic.wav
Speak into your mic for a few seconds

Then press Ctrl+C to stop recording

Then play it back:

bash
Copy
Edit
aplay test-mic.wav
üëâ Let me know:

Do you hear your voice now?

Or is it still silent?

This will tell us if PipeWire is actually passing mic audio through.







You said:
let's do this process from the start again
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî fresh start, one clear step at a time. I‚Äôve got your back. Let‚Äôs make your PD100X microphone work in OBS, starting clean.

üéôÔ∏è GOAL: Record audio with your PD100X USB microphone in OBS
‚úÖ Step 1: Confirm that your system sees the mic
