# 🎙️ Ubuntu + PipeWire + Audacity + PD100X Mic Troubleshooting

This README documents the troubleshooting steps taken to restore microphone recording functionality using the **PD100X Podcast Microphone** with **Audacity** on **Ubuntu (PipeWire-based system)**.

---

## ✅ System Overview

- **OS**: Ubuntu
- **Audio Server**: PipeWire (replacing PulseAudio)
- **Microphone**: PD100X Podcast Microphone
- **Audacity Version(s)**:
  - Flatpak (latest from Flathub)
  - Native (`apt install audacity`)

---

## 🔍 What Was Verified

- ✅ PipeWire is fully active (`pactl info` shows `PulseAudio (on PipeWire ...)`)
- ✅ PD100X mic is recognized and available as a source:  
  `alsa_input.usb-352f_PD100X_Podcast_Microphone_...:capture_MONO`
- ✅ System playback is working (e.g., YouTube audio)
- ✅ Mic works outside of Audacity (`arecord` tested)

---

## 🧪 What Was Tried

### 1. **Flatpak Audacity + PipeWire JACK Bridge**
- Launched with:  
  `pw-jack flatpak run org.audacityteam.Audacity`
- Issue: Audacity did not appear as a JACK client (not connectable in Helvum or `pw-link`)
- Mic showed up in `pw-link --output`, but no matching Audacity input was available in `pw-link --input`

### 2. **Helvum Visual Routing**
- Installed and opened Helvum via Flatpak
- Mic node was visible ✅
- Audacity node was not visible ❌

### 3. **Manual PipeWire Linking with `pw-link`**
- Listed mic output port successfully
- Could not complete routing because Audacity input port was not exposed

### 4. **Installed Native Audacity**
- Via: `sudo apt install audacity`
- Launched with and without JACK:
  - `audacity` (uses ALSA or Pulse)
  - `pw-jack audacity` (uses JACK)
- Still did not show up in Helvum or `pw-link` as a connectable input

---

## ❗ Issues Identified

- Flatpak Audacity does **not expose JACK input ports** — likely due to sandboxing
- Native Audacity also **did not register as a JACK client**, possibly due to runtime environment or launch method

## ✅ Confirmed Working Components

| Component | Status |
|----------|--------|
| PD100X Mic | ✅ Detected |
| PipeWire | ✅ Running correctly |
| Helvum | ✅ Installed and working |
| `pw-link` | ✅ Lists mic port |
| Flatpak Audacity | ⚠️ Limited JACK visibility |
| Native Audacity | ⚠️ Needs test with ALSA/Pulse backend |

## 🔮 Next Steps

### ✅ Option 1: Try Native Audacity Without JACK

```bash
