### ✅ My System Audio Is Fixed — Now Back to Audacity Recording Issue

Hi again! I'm back. Here's a quick summary of where we left off:

- I'm on **Ubuntu**, using **PipeWire (with PulseAudio)**.
- My mic is a **PD100X Podcast Microphone**, and it's working fine via `arecord`.
- System playback is working again — ✅ YouTube sound is back!
- I'm using the **Flatpak version of Audacity** (latest, already installed).
- In Audacity, the **Audio Host dropdown only shows ALSA and JACK** — no PulseAudio or PipeWire options.
- I’ve tried launching with `AUDIODRIVER=pulseaudio`, and also applied Flatpak overrides, but no luck.

➡️ **I want to be able to record from my PD100X in Audacity.**  
Please help me continue from this point to resolve the issue.  
I'm open to fixing JACK routing, building Audacity from source, or trying another reliable approach.

When you're ready, just paste that in and I’ll pick it up from there. Talk soon — and great work troubleshooting so far! 💪
