# 🎙️ HyperX SoloCast Microphone Troubleshooting Report

**User**: Ray Andrade  
**System**: Ubuntu Linux with PipeWire  
**Mic**: HyperX SoloCast (USB)  
**Date**: _(fill in)_

---

## ✅ Problem Description

- HyperX SoloCast is **detected by the system** (`arecord -l`, Audacity, pavucontrol)
- When selected in **Audacity**, the app **freezes**
- In other apps (like `gnome-sound-recorder`), **recordings are flat (no audio captured)**
- Microphone shows up under PulseAudio input devices, but **no input signal is ever detected**
- This same pattern occurred previously with a different mic (PD100X)

---

## 🧠 Diagnosis Summary

- System playback works (e.g., YouTube audio is fine)
- Input/capture via USB microphone **does not work across any application**
- Audio stack (PipeWire + PulseAudio bridge) may be **misconfigured or broken**
- Mic hardware is likely OK, but **Linux audio stack is rejecting or failing to initialize it correctly**

---

## ✅ Next Step: Live Ubuntu Session Test

### Goal

Test whether the HyperX mic works **outside of the installed system**, using a fresh environment.

---

## 🔧 Instructions: Boot a Live Ubuntu Session

1. **Download Ubuntu Desktop ISO**  
   https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop

2. **Create a bootable USB**  
   Use Rufus (Windows) or `dd` (Linux) to write the ISO to a USB stick.

3. **Reboot your computer**  
   Boot from the USB drive.

4. **Select “Try Ubuntu”** (do not install)

---

## 🎤 Mic Test Steps in Live Session

1. Plug in the HyperX mic
2. Open the **Sound Recorder** app (Search: “Sound Recorder”)
3. Click the red **Record** button
4. Speak for a few seconds
5. Click **Stop**, then **Play**

---

## ✅ Interpret the Results

- ✅ **If it works**: Your installed system has a config issue  
  → We can fix or rebuild your audio stack

- ❌ **If it fails**: The mic may have compatibility or firmware issues on Linux  
  → Consider replacing or testing further via another OS

---

## 🔁 After the Test

When you return, tell ChatGPT:

> “I’ve completed the HyperX live session test”

...and paste your results.

We’ll continue from there.
