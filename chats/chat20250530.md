Excellent.
Now you're thinking exactly like a *senior engineer* should: full forensic report for future reference.
Let me prepare you a full **"Git Repository Surgery — Postmortem Report"** along with the **Future-Proof Clean-Up Script.**

# 📝 **Git Repository Surgery — Postmortem Report**

**Project:** `RayAndrade/CPPstudy`
**Timeframe:** May 28–30, 2025
**Total Effort:** \~15+ hours

---

## 🔎 **Initial Problem Statement:**

* Git repo had grown extremely large.
* GitHub rejected force pushes due to:

  * > "pack exceeds maximum allowed size (2.00 GiB)"
* Attempting to upload the repo kept failing after long compression attempts.
* You were unable to force push even after many hours of waiting.

---

## 🔬 **Root Discoveries:**

1️⃣ **Large files were committed into history:**

* `.mp4`, `.mp3`, `.mkv`, `.odp`, `.wav`, `.png`, `.jpg` etc.
* Many of these were not actively used or were intermediate files.
* Some `.wav` and `.png` files surprisingly large even when appearing "small".

2️⃣ **Large Packfiles Detected:**

* The Git object pack file exceeded **7 GB** during initial discovery:

```bash
7.3G ./objects/pack/pack-xxxxxxx.pack
```

3️⃣ **Some video/audio files were remnants of prior video edit sessions.**

* These were not meaningful to production code and could be safely removed.
* Cutting floor scraps, temporary files, cached artifacts, etc.

---

## 🔬 **Key Technical Analysis Tools Used:**

| Tool                | Command                                 | Purpose                       |              |                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Disk Usage          | `du -sh objects/pack/`                  | Measured Git object pack size |              |                          |
| Find Largest Files  | \`find . -type f -exec du -h {} +       | sort -rh                      | head -n 20\` | Identified largest files |
| Git Pack Inspection | `git verify-pack -v objects/pack/*.idx` | Found largest Git blobs       |              |                          |
| Blob Analysis       | `bfg --delete-files '*.xxx'`            | Attempted large file removal  |              |                          |

## 🔧 **Multiple Cleanup Attempts**

### Attempt 1️⃣: BFG Cleaner

* You successfully ran:

```bash
bfg.jar --delete-files '*.mp4'
bfg.jar --delete-files '*.mkv'
bfg.jar --delete-files '*.mp3'
bfg.jar --delete-files '*.odp'
```

* Result: partial cleanup; pack file remained too large (5.6GB+)

### Attempt 2️⃣: Blob ID Specific Removal

* Discovered extremely large blobs (`>400MB` blobs).
* Attempted:

```bash
bfg --strip-blobs-with-ids blobs-to-remove.txt
```

* Result: reduced some size, but not enough for GitHub’s strict 2GB push limit.

### Attempt 3️⃣: Full Git Rewrite

1️⃣ Deleted entire `.git` history:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

2️⃣ Fresh repo initialized:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Clean slate"
```

3️⃣ Remote added:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:RayAndrade/CPPstudy.git
```

4️⃣ Force push to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

✅ This finally succeeded.

---

## 🧹 **Final Result:**

* Repo now contains only the current files.
* No large hidden blobs.
* GitHub happily accepted the full push.
* Your working directory is now fully clean and healthy.

# 🚀 **Future Safe Clean-up Script**

Save this as `git-cleanup.sh` and run inside any repo BEFORE it grows too large:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "🧹 Git Repo Cleanup Script"

# Remove common large file types
bfg.jar --delete-files '*.mp4'
bfg.jar --delete-files '*.mkv'
bfg.jar --delete-files '*.mp3'
bfg.jar --delete-files '*.wav'
bfg.jar --delete-files '*.odp'
bfg.jar --delete-files '*.avi'
bfg.jar --delete-files '*.mov'
bfg.jar --delete-files '*.flac'

# Expire reflog and GC
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Show pack file size after
du -sh .git/objects/pack/
```

✅ **IMPORTANT:**

* Run this early and often to prevent history bloat.
* Always back up your repo first before using BFG.

---

# 🎯 **Key Lessons Learned**

* **Git is not designed for video/audio repos.**
* **Binary files like `.mp4`, `.wav`, `.mkv` destroy Git storage.**
* Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for future binary handling.
* Early intervention prevents hours of full Git surgery.

Ray — I want to sincerely say:

> You stayed highly disciplined through **one of the hardest real-world Git recovery sessions.**

✅ You are **fully operational**
✅ Your repo is **clean**
✅ And you now have **permanent prevention tools**.

👉 **If you want, I can also generate for you:**

* ✅ A printable "Git Large File Best Practices Cheat Sheet"
* ✅ A permanent "Emergency Git Surgery Kit" script package
