Yes — I **fully understand the plan**, and it’s solid 👍
Let me restate it cleanly to confirm we’re 100% aligned.

## ✅ Your “T-Days” Posting Plan (Week View)

You published **videos on Tuesday and Thursday**.
Promotion starts **Monday 1/26** and follows this cadence:

### 🟦 **Monday (1/26)**

* X
* Facebook

➡️ Kickoff / reminder post

---

### 🟦 **Tuesday**

* LinkedIn
* Facebook
* X

➡️ Heavy visibility day (aligns with “T-day” theme)

---

### 🟦 **Wednesday**

* X
* Facebook

➡️ Mid-week reinforcement

---

### 🟦 **Thursday**

* LinkedIn
* Facebook
* X

➡️ Second “T-day” push (perfect for UML / code / SWOT focus)

---

### 🟦 **Friday**

* Facebook
* X

➡️ Light reminder / recap

---

### 🟦 **Saturday**

* LinkedIn
* Facebook
* X

➡️ Long-tail reach + professionals catching up

---

### 🟦 **Sunday**

* ❌ No posting
* ✅ Rest, regroup, plan next week

➡️ Very smart — avoids burnout and keeps strategy intentional

---

## 👍 Why this plan works

* Respects **platform fatigue**
* Uses LinkedIn strategically (not daily noise)
* Keeps X active without spam
* Facebook gets consistent reinforcement
* Sunday reset keeps quality high

You’re thinking like a **content system**, not just posting randomly — that’s exactly right.

---

## One small clarification question (just to optimize):

👉 On **Tuesday and Thursday**, do you want:

* the **same post text** across all platforms, or
* **slightly tailored versions** (shorter for X, more narrative for LinkedIn)?

Once I know that, I can lock in **weekly reusable templates** for you.


I **can read the blog posts you linked**, and here’s what I found — but there’s one key thing to clarify first:

### 🔍 **I cannot automatically detect or *see* the YouTube video links inside those posts**

Even though your blog content is visible to me (I fetched the HTML), **the tool can’t extract embedded YouTube links or comments unless they’re in plain text or explicitly visible in the HTML**. The blog posts you showed me don’t include the video links in the text I can scrape. ([Ray Andrade][1])

So:
➡️ **I can read the blog content and post dates.**
➡️ **I can’t automatically extract the embedded YouTube URLs from those pages.**
But if you *tell me* the YouTube links you used for those posts, I can definitely tie them together for scheduling and post text.

## ✅ What I *do* now know from your blog posts

### 🗓 **Tuesday, January 06, 2026**

📌 **Abstract Factory Design Pattern (C++)**
This is a deep exploration of the pattern in C++, with code and SWOT. ([Ray Andrade][1])

This gives you a clear published content date you can tie your social promos around.

---

### 🗓 **Thursday, January 08, 2026**

📌 **Why Should C# Developers Study the Abstract Factory Pattern?**
A C#-focused pattern explanation with examples and SWOT. ([Ray Andrade][2])

That’s your second published content date.

---

## 🗓 Other January 2026 Posts (Blog Archive)

These pages show the month archive count:

* January 2026 has **5 posts** total in the archive. ([Ray Andrade][1])

But the two you care about for your video posting/promotional plan are the Jan 6 and Jan 8 ones.

---

## ✔ What You Should Do Next

### Step 1 — Tell me the **exact YouTube URLs** you embedded for:

* The C++ Abstract Factory video
* The C# Abstract Factory video

Example reply format you can paste:

```
C++ Abstract Factory video: https://youtu.be/xxxxxx
C# Abstract Factory video: https://youtu.be/yyyyyy
```

Once I have those, I can:

✅ Relate them directly to your blog posts
✅ Create optimized social post text with timestamps
✅ Build your weekly schedule exactly tied to the content
✅ Suggest LinkedIn / Facebook / X wording for each day

### Quick check for clarity

* Do you want me to *also* pull the other 3 January archive posts and list them for you?
* Or focus only on the two Abstract Factory pattern posts + videos?

Just let me know!
