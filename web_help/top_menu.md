Yes 👍 — those options are normal when you’re using **Blocksy** together with **Elementor**. I’ll explain each one **in plain English**, focusing on *what it’s for* and *when you’d actually use it*.

---

## 🔧 **Customize**

**What it does:**
Opens the **WordPress Customizer**, but specifically with **Blocksy’s controls**.

**Used for:**

* Site-wide layout (header, footer, sidebar)
* Typography (fonts, sizes)
* Colors & backgrounds
* Blog layout, spacing, container width

**Important:**
This affects the **entire site**, not just one page.

👉 Use this when you want to change how the *whole website* looks.

---

## ➕ **+ New**

**What it does:**
Quickly create new content.

**Common options inside:**

* Page
* Post
* Content Block (Blocksy)
* Template (Elementor)

👉 Just a shortcut — same as **Dashboard → Add New**, but faster.

---

## ⚡ **Caching**

*(This appears because of Bluehost / performance tools)*

**What it does:**
Controls **page caching** to make your site load faster.

**Typical actions:**

* Clear / purge cache
* Enable or disable caching temporarily

**When to use it:**

* After changing layouts, styles, or templates
* When something looks “old” or not updated on the frontend

👉 If something doesn’t look right, **clear cache first**.

---

## 📝 **Notes**

**What it does:**
Adds **admin notes** for yourself or other admins.

**Used for:**

* Reminders
* “Don’t touch this section”
* Tracking edits or experiments

👉 Has **zero effect** on visitors.

## 🧩 **Elementor Debugger**

**What it does:**
Helps diagnose **Elementor problems**.

**Shows things like:**

* Missing templates
* JS/CSS loading errors
* Conflicts with themes or plugins
* Safe Mode access

👉 Only use this when:

## 🖼️ **Image Guide Action**

*(Blocksy-specific helper tool)*

**What it does:**
Provides **image size guidance** for Blocksy sections.

**Used for:**

👉 Helpful when images look stretched or blurry.

## 🧱 **Content Blocks** *(Very Important in Blocksy)*

**What it does:**
This is **Blocksy’s superpower**.

**Content Blocks let you create reusable sections**, such as:

* Custom headers
* Footers

* Call-to-action banners
* Conditional templates (only on blog, only on category, etc.)

**Works with:**

* Gutenberg **or**
* Elementor

👉 This is where Blocksy replaces a lot of “theme hacks”.
