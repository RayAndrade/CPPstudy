The Adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

In essence it allows for two different classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface the other class expects.

The Adapter patterns can be seen as a wrapper that modifies an existing class interface without altering the underline code,

This pattern typically involves three roles
Target : This is an interface the client expects or uses.
Adaptee : This in existing interface that needs to be adapted
Adaptor: This is a class that joins functionality of independent or incompatible interfaces i.e. it makes the Adapter interface compatible with the target interface
