Hello my name is Ray . I am the Ray in The Ray Code
In this video I will covering the Adapter design pattern
I will be using C++
Not C#, but C++.. 

Although I do tutorials in C# and other programming languages,
This video will be in C++ 

But don't let me prevent you from watching those videos In fact I encourage you to check them out but don't leave this video. 

That is another metric YouTube looks at

You can do this, tell your friend, put it on your cover letter and resume and say it on your voice mail.

Share it on your Social media And Like it on mine

I understand this is the optimum way to go viral

I have put time stamps in the margin so you may navigate to the section you desire most

My favorite is the SWOT analysis 

I use other programming languages to cover this this design patterns 
And I have USED THIS programming language  ALL the other design patterns that were given by the gang of four
